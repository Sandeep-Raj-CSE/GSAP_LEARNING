# Learning GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

Welcome to the GSAP learning repository! GSAP, short for GreenSock Animation Platform, is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations and interactive experiences on the web.

## Getting Started

To start learning GSAP, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: If you haven't already, install GSAP in your project. You can do this via npm, yarn, or by including the GSAP CDN in your HTML file.

2. **Basic Usage**: Begin by understanding the basic syntax and concepts of GSAP animations. You can start by animating simple elements like divs, images, or SVGs.

3. **Tweening**: Learn about tweening, which is the core concept of GSAP. Tweening allows you to smoothly animate properties of an element over time.

4. **Easing**: Explore different easing functions to add life and personality to your animations. GSAP provides a variety of easing options to customize the feel of your animations.

5. **Timeline**: Master the timeline feature of GSAP to create complex sequences and choreograph multiple animations together.

6. **Plugins**: Discover GSAP plugins that extend its capabilities, such as ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations, SplitText for text animations, and more.

7. **Documentation and Resources**: Refer to the official GSAP documentation for detailed guides, API reference, and code examples. Additionally, explore online tutorials, blog posts, and forums to deepen your understanding and learn best practices.
